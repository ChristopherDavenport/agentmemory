# Every first-party module a nested module requires must also be

# itself, and it is load-bearing at release time too.
#
# Every module is released at one version, from one commit, and requires
# its siblings at exactly that version — a version the proxy cannot serve
# until the tag is pushed. The replace is what lets the release commit
# resolve, tidy and build. Lose one and the next release fails at make
# tidy, or silently pins that module to the previous release.
#
# A replace is a property of the main module, so consumers ignore it and
# get the require. That is safe only because the require names the commit
# the module is tagged from; release-guard is what proves it.

# Every module is released at one version, from one commit, and requires
# its first-party siblings at exactly that version. So the first thing
# this does is point every nested module at VERSION — a version that does
# not exist yet. That resolves because each nested go.mod replaces its
# first-party requirements with the tree (see replaces above); tidy,
# build and test all see the code being tagged.
#
# --atomic lands every ref in one transaction, so no window exists in
# which one tag is visible without the others, and none in which a
# published go.mod names a version the proxy cannot serve.
#
# The root is guarded and tagged first, then each nested module, because
# a nested module's guard proves the root tag of that version names this
# commit — which it cannot do before that tag exists. Every tag is local
# until the push; if a guard refuses, undo with git reset --hard HEAD~1
# and git tag -d the tags written.
#
# TRAILER, when set, is appended to the commit message.
#
# The changelog is dated through a temp file rather than sed -i, which is
# a GNU-ism: BSD sed reads the argument after -i as a backup suffix, so
# the GNU spelling fails outright on macOS, where these releases are cut.
# The temp file is removed if sed dies, so a failed run leaves nothing
# untracked behind for the clean-tree gate to trip over next time.
